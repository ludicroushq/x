# Introduction

X Framework is a modern Node.js framework designed to give you complete freedom in choosing your tech stack. Unlike traditional frameworks that force you into specific patterns or technologies, X adapts to your preferences, allowing you to use any database, authentication system, or API layer you prefer.

## Core Concepts

X Framework is built around the concept of adapters - modular pieces that integrate your favorite tools and libraries into a cohesive application. The framework provides a simple, type-safe way to compose these adapters together.

```ts
import { createX } from "@xframework/x";
import { HonoAdapter } from "@xframework/hono";
import { DrizzleAdapter } from "@your-db-adapter/drizzle";
import { StripeAdapter } from "@xframework/stripe";
import { BetterAuthAdapter } from "@xframework/better-auth";
import { LogTapeAdapter } from "@xframework/logtape";

export const x = createX()
  .syncAdapter("hono", () => new HonoAdapter(hono))
  .syncAdapter("db", () => new DrizzleAdapter(drizzle))
  .syncAdapter("stripe", () => new StripeAdapter(stripe))
  .syncAdapter("auth", () => new BetterAuthAdapter(auth))
  .syncAdapter("logger", () => new LogTapeAdapter(logTape));
```

## Key Features

- **Ecosystem Freedom**: Use any library or tool you love - X adapts to your stack
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with excellent type inference
- **Modular Design**: Add only what you need through the adapter system
- **Async/Sync Support**: Work with both synchronous and asynchronous adapters seamlessly
- **Composable**: Easily combine multiple adapters to build your application
