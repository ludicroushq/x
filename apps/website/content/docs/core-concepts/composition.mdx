# Composition

X Framework allows you to compose multiple adapters together and reuse them across your application.

```ts
import { createX } from "@xframework/x";

// Create base instance with common adapters
const baseX = createX()
  .syncAdapter("config", () => new ConfigAdapter(config))
  .syncAdapter("logger", () => new LogTapeAdapter());

// Create app instance with additional adapters
const appX = baseX
  .syncAdapter("hono", () => new HonoAdapter(app))
  .syncAdapter("auth", () => new BetterAuthAdapter(auth));
```
